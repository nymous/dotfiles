# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, with some instructions on how to setup an Archlinux installation.

## Dotfiles

Dotfiles are not managed for now, since my new install is pretty empty.

## First install

Instructions for the Archlinux installation process are available in the [dedicated file](./archlinux_setup.md).

## Development

I use [pre-commit][pre-commit] to automatically build a TOC in .md files.
